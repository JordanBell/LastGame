Repository for the game titled "Last". 

In the early stages of this repository, it is simply a prototype for a tile-based game with discrete movement mechanics. Using SDL and the groundwork of another SDL project I've been working on in parallel, the game's coming along real nicely. This is one of those brainchild attempts at a game, that I look forward to seeing it develop. 

Ironic, how this game is titled "Last" when it's actually the very first game I've developed in C++.
