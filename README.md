Repository for the game titled "Last". 

In the early stages of this repository, it is simply a prototype for a tile-based game with discrete movement mechanics. Using SDL and the groundwork of another SDL project I've been working on in parallel, the game's coming along real nicely. This is one of those "This felt like I really good idea in my head" attempts at a game, that I look forward to seeing develop. 

Funny enough, how this game is titled "Last" when it's actually the very first game I've developed in C++.

------------------------

Currently on hold due to issues with, essentially, creating a veritable rendering engine from scratch. Currently pursuing options of either: 1) Just get on with it or figure it out, or 2) Delegate to an already working library like SFML from the pure C libarary SDL. That, in itself, has a sizeable overhead of replacing half of the underlying graphics mechanics.
